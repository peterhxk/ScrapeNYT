Machine Learning Media Bias by Tegmark et al.
Summarize and highlight how we can adapt it to Geopolitical Bias

Summarize:
They use machine learning to scan articles and use sentences to predict two things:
- First, the political aspect of the articles in terms of the political left and right scale, aka conservative and liberative.
- Second, which news paper establishment published it.

How we can adapt it to Geopolitical Bias:
They use MITNewsClassify package from https://www.improvethenews.org/news-slider for classifying their articles in the political scale of left and right.
To adapt it for Geopolitical Bias, instead of the left and right scale, we can use its "establishment stance".
The establishment stance feature is capable of identifying how bias are the articles towards countries.
Then we can use the similar methods from the article to achieve what we want.
